Contrasting colors
==================

Twelve contrasting colors that I've used for charts, to make sure each data series can be distinguished from the others. If you have more than 12 data series... well, you need to have fewer data series, IMO.

The colors are dark-ish so that they will work against a white or a light grey background. Other light pastel backgrounds should work as well.

Look at the png included, or [visit a web tool](http://www.colorcombos.com/combomaker.html?design=squares&output_width=70&size_option=element&colors=BB2114,0C5966,BA7814,4459AB,6B3838,B8327B,2B947F,0D83B5,684287,8C962C,92289E,242D7D&background_color=FFFFFF&show_hex_flag=Y) that shows these colors.
